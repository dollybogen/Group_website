[{"content":"Our Project Use Case Diagram Our team aims to divide the entire system into the following six core modules. We have chosen to work on the Recovery Analysis \u0026amp; Prediction Module.\nMain Functions and Key Technologies 1. Data Collection Module Functions:\nReal-time collection of lower limb motion data using angle sensors (e.g., MPU-6050) Data transmission to the mobile device via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Sensor data preprocessing (data formatting, time synchronization, etc.) Key Technologies:\nHardware interfaces (I2C/SPI for MEMS sensor data retrieval) BLE wireless communication (Bluetooth module connection \u0026amp; low-power data transfer) Data time synchronization (sensor timestamp correction) 2. Data Processing Module Functions:\nFiltering \u0026amp; noise reduction (minimizing sensor errors and environmental interference) Calculation of joint angles, motion trajectories, velocity, and acceleration Data interpolation and smoothing (Kalman filter) Key Technologies:\nSignal processing (Kalman filter, moving average filter) Mathematical modeling (Euler angle conversion, kinematics computation) Optimization algorithms (noise reduction, precision enhancement) 3. Data Storage Module Functions:\nLocal \u0026amp; cloud storage of patient rehabilitation data Maintenance of historical data for trend analysis \u0026amp; forecasting Fast data retrieval (search by time, recovery progress) Key Technologies:\nDatabase storage (SQLite / Firebase / cloud storage) Data indexing (improving query efficiency) Data synchronization (ensuring consistency between local \u0026amp; cloud data) 4. Recovery Analysis \u0026amp; Prediction Module Functions:\nCalculation of patient recovery progress (comparison with normal recovery curves) AI-based prediction (forecasting future recovery trends based on historical data) Generation of personalized reports (rehabilitation data visualization) Key Technologies:\nMachine learning (linear regression / ARIMA time series prediction) Statistical analysis (mean, standard deviation, recovery trends) Data visualization (Matplotlib / D3.js for chart rendering) 5. Rehabilitation Training Recommendation Module Functions:\nPersonalized rehabilitation training plan based on the patient’s current data Video / GIF demonstrations of rehabilitation exercises Recording training effectiveness to optimize future plans Key Technologies:\nAI recommendation algorithms (matching optimal training plans to user data) Video / animation playback (embedding training demonstration videos) User feedback system (patient feedback after training \u0026amp; adaptive adjustments) 6. User Interface \u0026amp; Mobile App Module Functions:\nIntuitive display of real-time motion data Presentation of rehabilitation progress, training plans, and AI predictions Remote data sharing functionality (allowing doctors to monitor patient data) Key Technologies:\nCross-platform development (Flutter / React Native / Android / iOS) Data visualization (ECharts / Chart.js) Remote data access (RESTful API / WebSocket) Module Relationships 1 [Data Collection] → [Data Processing] → [Data Storage] → [Recovery Analysis \u0026amp; Prediction] → [Rehabilitation Training Recommendation] → [User Interface \u0026amp; Mobile App] ","date":"2025-03-18T00:00:00Z","image":"http://localhost:1313/Group_website/p/%E9%A1%B9%E7%9B%AE%E7%94%A8%E4%BE%8B%E5%9B%BE/%E9%A1%B9%E7%9B%AE%E7%94%A8%E4%BE%8B%E5%9B%BE_hu5758844009908307626.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/Group_website/p/%E9%A1%B9%E7%9B%AE%E7%94%A8%E4%BE%8B%E5%9B%BE/","title":"Project Use Case Diagram and Module Division"},{"content":"组员： 21220121陈子恒（组长） 21221128应宇椽 21220415杨子强 55220314邓琦\n","date":"2025-03-09T00:00:00Z","image":"http://localhost:1313/Group_website/p/name_list/bfa716fb67d4d01aae4393a7de1d4effc73b6ba2_hu12973939456545149209.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/Group_website/p/name_list/","title":"Member list"}]
